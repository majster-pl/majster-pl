- 👋 Hi, I’m Szymon Waliczek also known as @majster-pl
- 👀 I’m interested in PHP, Laravel and all cool technologies around Laravel which help me create useful applications - usually to sort real life problems 🙂.
- 🌱 I’m currently waiting to see if I'll fit into School Of Code bootcamp which starts in September 2022 but in the meantime I've started CS50 course on edX and planing to complete it in next couple of weeks. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project to improve my skills. 
- 📫 You can reach me out via my email: waliczek.szymon@gmail.com
